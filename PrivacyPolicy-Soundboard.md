# Privacy Policy

(DD/MM/YY)
**Effective Date:** 07/06/25 
**Last Updated:** 07/06/25

## Overview

Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how our soundboard application ("UntitledSoundboard") handles your information. Simply put: we don't collect, store, transmit, or use any of your personal information.

## Information Collection and Use

**We do not collect any personal information.** The App operates entirely on your device and does not:

- Collect personal data of any kind
- Access your contacts, location, or other personal information
- Require account creation or registration
- Connect to external servers or services
- Transmit any data from your device

## Data Storage

All app functionality occurs locally on your device. Any sounds, settings, or preferences you configure are stored only on your device and never leave it. We have no access to this information.

## Third-Party Services

The App does not integrate with any third-party services, analytics platforms, or advertising networks that would collect your data.

## Children's Privacy

Since we do not collect any information whatsoever, the App is safe for users of all ages, including children under 13, in compliance with COPPA (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act).

## Data Security

Because no data is collected or transmitted, there are no data security concerns related to information leaving your device. All app data remains under your direct control on your local device.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted within the App and will take effect immediately upon posting. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.

## International Users

Since no data is collected or processed, there are no cross-border data transfer concerns regardless of your location.

## Your Rights

Since we don't collect any personal information, there is no personal data for you to access, modify, or delete from our systems. You maintain full control over any local app data by managing it directly through your device settings.
